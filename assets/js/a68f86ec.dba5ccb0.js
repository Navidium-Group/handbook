With the recent changes in compliance regulations set by the IMO (International Maritime Organization), the awareness among the crew members and owners about their ship performance has become increasingly important. They need to know whether their ships are satisfying all the required environmental compliances, and how much is the ship's energy consumption, fuel costs, and operating costs. This is where \u201cvessel performance management\u201d comes into action. Vessel performance management offers and supports the owners, crew members, and other customers to reduce energy consumption, fuel usage, and operating costs of the ships while supporting environmental compliances. This is done by benchmarking the efficiencies of its historical performance allowing opportunities to minimize fuel usage and CO2 emissions, which are major challenges in the shipping industry.

Every organization has its data policies and data format by which they maintain these records on priority to monitor their ship\u2019s performance.

Few essential indicators like CO2 efficiency, hull, main engine & auxiliary equipment analysis, speed-power curve, engine load curves, tracking fuel consumption, trim, propeller condition, weather conditions, and total cost savings provide the shipowners and managers with information to make critical decisions to help increase the efficiency of their fleet. "),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"fuel-savings"},"Fuel Savings:"),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Among these KPIs, the most important indicator is the amount of fuel consumption of the vessel. With the mission of net zero carbon emission, the organizations are trying to cover the basic compliances related to the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI), Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI), and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). Developing solutions to optimize fuel consumption considers various factors such as environmental conditions and intrinsic design features of the ship like the hull and propeller condition. Hull hydrodynamics is a major critical factor for the vessel's performance because as the resistance offered by the sea becomes greater, more fuel would be required to maneuver the vessel through the water. Also considering the environmental factors such as wind force, speed, and direction, current speed, and direction, sometimes may or may not favor the movement of the vessel. Keeping track or knowing the weather conditions would help to provide an optimum route for the captains to navigate their voyage in the best route possible. This helps to choose the best engine operating conditions and the speed for the vessel in the given situation. Over time the hull performance reduces due to fouling and the vessel has to be dry-docked to undergo hull and propeller cleaning. Any overconsumption of fuel with projection in time is estimated accurately so that the need to perform the hull and propeller cleaning can be decided and assessed simultaneously. Therefore the operators not only just want to cut costs but also try to achieve greater efficiencies. Weather-based route planning allows up to 3% fuel savings. Hull and propeller condition management can provide up to 10% fuel savings compared to a fouled hull. A well-optimized trimmed vessel is also believed to make energy savings by using the least expensive energy efficiency measures i.e by using simple ballast modification."),(0,s.kt)("h2",{id:"data-processing-and-usage"},"Data processing and usage:"),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"The modern vessel performance management systems require a large amount of data but also require processing, interpretation, validation, and creation of reports delivery of charts to the navigation system (ECDIS) on board, as well as recommendations for the best route according to weather, fuel consumption, and other reports.
