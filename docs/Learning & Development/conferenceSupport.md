# Conference, Meetup & Opensource Support

## Conference or Meetup Speaker?
Would you like to speak at a conference or Meetup about the work you‚Äôre doing at Navidium? 
We encourage everyone to get involved in their local meetup community and if you decide to take ‚Äúthe leap‚Äù and hold a talk of your own we‚Äôre very happy to reward you with a ‚Ç¨300 gift voucher of your choice ü•≥

## Open Source Contribution
The Open Source community is an amazing place to learn, make new friends and further sharpen your skills.
The Navidium Engineering Organisation is proud to be a regular contributor into the open source community. We encourage everyone to actively contribute and share experiences when doing so and we follow up with all of our people on what Open Source repositories they contribute to so we make sure we‚Äôre always supporting your passion for code. Make sure you speak to your manager on how they can best support you to do this.

### Open Source Repositories we love to take inspiration from
