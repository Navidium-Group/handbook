# Career Paths

Understanding how you can progress your career in Navidium is vital to us and we want to make it as clear as possible for all employees.

Developers often feel that to grow in their career they have to move into management and this regularly results in people becoming people managers who really aren't best suited to that role. Below you will see how we support our people to move vertically and horizontally across the Navidium Organisation.
