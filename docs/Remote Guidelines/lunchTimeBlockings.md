# Lunch Time Calendar Blockings

Through one of our retrospectives we discovered that some product discovery and R&D workshops we were running happened to be running through different peoples lunch times depending on what timezone they were in.

We try not to have a lot of synchronous meetings but at different times they're important so we all decided to try adding to our shared calendars two one hour time slot blockings through the day that we should avoid booking meetings. 

- 1:30pm -> 2:30pm India Time
- 12:00pm -> 13:00 Central European Time.

Of course you're welcome to take your lunch whenever you want or even during meetings but by doing this we are making sure we're not forcing people to work during their normal lunch times.
