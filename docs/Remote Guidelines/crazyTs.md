# Crazy T's (Previously Crazy Tuesdays)

We all need some focus time to complete work. We try to restrict meetings and other activities as much as possible to allow us to find flow and complete work but it's inevitable that interruptions will happen throughout a day.

Because of this we created the Crazy T's. Tuesdays and Thursdays are full days totally reserved for concentrated work. Nobody is allowed to create meetings on these days and it's reserved for your own work, adhoc pair programming or brain storming.
Due to the success of the original Crazy Tuesdays we decided to expand it to include Thursdays as well meaning it became "Crazy T's" instead of "Crazy Tuesdays"

## Async Standup

On Crazy Days we use a tool called Geekbot meaning we don't have our regular synchronous standup. Geekbot sends everyone in the team some questions about their previous days work and their plans for the day. Everyone's answers are shared with the teams public channel once they've answered in their own time.

## Achieving Flow on Normal Days
Some times you just need to concetrate regardless of it being a Crazy Day or not. We have introduced a Slack status called 'In Flow (Concentrating)'. This indicates to people that you should not be disturbed. The status can be set for up to 4 hours at a time.
