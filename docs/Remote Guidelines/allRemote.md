# All Remote Slack Channel

In our effort to continuously improve we need to openly share ideas and talk about those improvements. We have a public slack channel that everyone is automatically added to when joining called #all-remote.

Any discussions, interesting blog posts or ideas you have about how we can continue to make remote life our superpower are strong encouraged to be shared in this channel.
