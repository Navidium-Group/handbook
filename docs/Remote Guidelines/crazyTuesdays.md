# Crazy Tuesdays

We all need some focus time to complete work. We try to restrict meetings and other activities as much as possible to allow us to complete that work but it's inevitable that interruptions will happen throughout a day.

Because of this we've created Crazy Tuesdays. This is a full day totally reserved for concentrated work. Nobody is allowed to create meetings on these days and it's reserved for your own work, adhoc pair programming or brain storming.
