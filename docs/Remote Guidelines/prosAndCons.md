# Pros & Cons of Remote Working

## Pros
 - You don't need to commute to work. Instead spend that time doing things you love instead (did someone say morning yoga?).
 - Ability to travel and work at the same time.
 - Set up your work space exactly as you like it.
 - Possible to spend more time close to loved ones or animals.
 - More flexibility in the times you're working. (We practice ASYNC working as much as we can).
 - Easier to have concentrated focus time.
 - Work in your pyjamas?

## Cons
 - The lines between work and personal space can become blurred unless you make specific efforts to plan your time & working space.
 - Easy to get distracted and "over commit" to family activities.
 - Hard to really get to know your colleagues and spend time having small conversations beside a coffee machine.
 - Easier to get lonely without personal interactions.
 - Days can suddenly become meeting heavy since small conversations aren't happening naturally in the office.
