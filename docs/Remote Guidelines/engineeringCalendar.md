# Engineering Holiday Calendar

To enable us to be as flexible and async as possible we need to be transparent on when our team members can rely on us.

For this we use a shared calendar that everyone in Product & Engineering are automatically invited to. Everyone is expected to add days off, half days off etc into this calendar so your team members aren't trying to find you on days you're not around.

## Public Holidays

Since we have people in a range of different countries around the world it's common for us to have public holidays at different times. We're also flexible for you to take public holidays at different times if that's better for you.
For example, If there is a public holiday in your country on a thursday but you would prefer to take that day off on the Friday. That's no problem. Just be sure to keep it updated in our shared calendar
