# Introduction

![Navidium Fish Bag](/img/navidium_bag.png)

Welcome to the Navidium Product & Engineering Handbook. Defining our remote culture is vital in the fast paced, multicultural organisation we work in. We've learnt that all the countries we operate in have their own ways of doing things, ways to communicate and ways of working. So we define what working in Navidium is like. We work on constantly improving that and writing about it to make sure it's understood and shared.

We're proud of our culture and love sharing with others why we think we're a great bunch of people to work with. The handbook serves 4 purposes.

1. A guide for everyone in Navidium Product & Engineering. Especially people joining our team.
2. A single source of truth that we point to continuously internally to make sure we're improving or sticking to ways of working we've agreed upon.
3. Inspiration for others not in Navidium to think about different ways of working to how they do in their own organisations.
4. Anyone thinking of joining Navidium can get more insight into daily life in Navidium.

## This is a joint effort (and public)

Everyone in Navidium is encouraged to contribute to our handbook. All edits and additions are encouraged. Simply create a PR onto the main branch in our handbook repository and once approved everything is automatically deployed to our public website.
