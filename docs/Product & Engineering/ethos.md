We find ways to talk about and support each other on the low days.</li><li>We have pandemics, floods, heatwaves, wars, illness and general hardship. The better we support each other in any kind of challenge the better we become.</li></ul>|
| 6. Limit Ambiguity | <ul><li>Ambiguity is the mother of all team development anti-patterns.</li><li>Teams are highly aligned, loosely coupled. We know what’s expected of us and our work weeks are clearly planned & communicated.</li></ul>|
