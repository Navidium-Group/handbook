# Smørekopp

![Smorekopp](/img/smorekopp.jpg)

__Smørekopp (Norwegian word for a kind of grease can)__

Instead of having a permanent scrum master role in our teams we've decided to have this as a rotating role within the team. This has brought us some really fun benefits
- Stops standups and sprint ceremonies from becoming stale
- Allows different people to bring their own "flare" to a sprint
- Brings new ideas into the sprint process
- After being in the driving seat everyone in the team has a new level of respect / understanding of the role and how to be as helpful as possible in the future to make things run smoothly (eg keeping tickets well updated)

If you're a part of one of our product teams then expect to be a Smørekopp a few times a year :)
