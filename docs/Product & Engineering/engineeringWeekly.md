# Engineering Weekly

![All Hands](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2Wl7Wpz09Z5hfi/giphy.gif)

We have one common weekly meeting for everyone and that's our Engineering Weekly meeting.

This is simply a time to make sure we're all in sync and communicating any important news or cool social activities coming up. All Engineering Weekly's are recorded and added to our shared drive so if you ever miss one you can catchup when you're back.
