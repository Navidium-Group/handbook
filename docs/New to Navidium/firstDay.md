 - Create your first PR and add your location to the [Where we sit in the world](/Product%20&%20Engineering/where) page.
 - Add any planned days off into the Engineering Holiday Calendar
 - Say hi to everyone on the #General slack channel
 - Read this handbook :) 
 - You will automatically be added to all code repositories and documentation groups
 - Share a picture of your remote setup in the #all-remote slack channel. We all love nerding out on how to best create the ultimate setup
 - See a mistake in the handbook? Create a PR and propose a fix
