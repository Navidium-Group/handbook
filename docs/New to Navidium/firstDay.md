# On Your First Day

We're super excited to have you join Navidium. Here we continue to note down a list of things you should think about on your first day / week.

 - Ask someone to add you to the Navidium SnapChat group (if you have snapchat)
 - Add any planned days off into the Engineering Holiday Calendar
 - Say hi to everyone on the #General slack channel
 - Read this handbook :) 
 - You will automatically be added to all code repositories and documentation groups
 - Share a picture of your remote setup in the #all-remote slack channel. We all love nerding out on how to best create the ultimate setup
 - See a mistake in the handbook? Create your first PR and propose a fix
